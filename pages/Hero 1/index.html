                    <h2>"Daughter of the Void"</h2>
                    <p>She did not descend from tribal warriors hardened by generations of battle, nor was she summoned from distant lands to fight the unknowable menace lurking beneath Shurima. Rather, she was just an ordinary girl, born to loving parents who called the unforgiving southern deserts their home.  This was where she would spend her days playing with friends, and her nights dreaming about her place in the world.</p>
